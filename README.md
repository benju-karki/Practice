# Practice
This repository contains my Python practice scripts, learning experiments, and mini-projects.   These are small projects I use to learn new concepts, test ideas, and improve my coding skills.

## Scripts

- **hello_world.py**: My first Python script to practice GitHub workflow and basic syntax.
- **dice_roll.py**: A simple dice roll simulation script that tracks results and demonstrates random number generation.
- **guessing_game.py**: A learning experiment to test loops, functions, and basic Python concepts.

> More scripts and experiments will be added as I continue learning.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Practice.git
